# machine-learning-notes

The notes of machine learning here is based on the specialization of machine learning on Coursera.
The specialization contains 3 courses and each folder in this repository corresponds to one course.

Folders:

- [supervised_learning: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [neural_network: Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms/home)
- [unsupervised_learning: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning)
